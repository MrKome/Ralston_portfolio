# [Project 2: Telco Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/MrKome/DS_Churn_Project/tree/main)

### Project Overview 

This project aims to predict Telco customer churn and provide insight into the performance of a company. By analysing various aspects of the data, we seek to identify trends and gain an understanding of the company's performance. 

### Data Source

Customer Churn Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn" file, containing detailed information about each customer. 

### Tools 

- Python 

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the customer churn data to answer key questions, such as: 

- How many people are churning vs how many people are returning?
- What is the percentage of customers that are leaving?
- Can we visualise the churn count for both male and females to see a correlation?
- Can we visualise the churn count for the internet service to see a correlation?

### Data Cleaning

In the intial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

- Data Loading and inspection
- Handling misssing Values
- Data Cleaning and formatting

### Prediction, Training and Testing

- Split the data into training and testing
- Create and train the model 
- Create the predictions on the test data

### Results/Findings

The prediction results are summarised as follows:
- We can see our model has a 91% recall,
- We can see our model has a 85% precsion
- We can see our model has a 88% f1-score
- We can see our model has an accuracy of 81%
